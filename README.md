# CoAPIDS #
![](Images/Banner.jpg)
CoAPIDS is an open-source tool for IoT traffic generation which supports the two widely used IoT
application layer protocols, i.e., MQTT and CoAP. CoAPIDS allows a user to create an IoT use case,
add customized IoT devices into it and generate normal and malicious IoT traffic over a real-time
network.

# Uses #
* CoAPIDS allows a user to generate the detailed custom packets.
* CoAPIDS can also be used in stress testing of different IoT-based network utilities like switches, routers, etc., by generating a large amount of IoT device traffic.
* It can be used for the designing and testing of IoT security providing entities like IDS, IPS, etc.
* CoAPIDS can help the researchers in IoT Security Research. The researchers can easily build their own use case, model IoT devices into it and then generate & analyse the traffic of the use case in order to develop better security solutions for IoT.
* The Network Engineers can use CoAPIDS for benchmarking the network features and to troubleshoot the network problems.

# IoT Attacks included in CoAPIDS #
Currently, we included four recent IoT application layer vulnerability attacks in the CoAPIDS: 
* MQTT Packet Crafting Attack (CVE-2016-10523)
* MQTT Publish Flood (CVE-2018-1684)
* CoAP Segmentation Fault Attack (CVE-2019-12101) 
* CoAP Memory Leak Attack (CVE-2019-9004)

##### CoAPthon (implementation of CoAP Protocol in Python) #####
First install the Python<br/>
sudo apt install python<br/>
sudo apt install python-pip<br/>
pip install CoAPthon<br/>
<br/>Link for Code: https://github.com/Tanganelli/CoAPthon<br/>

## 2) Download the Source Code ##
Source Code is download from : https://github.com/ThingzDefense/CoAPIDS
## 3) Build the Source Code ##
import the 'IoTFlock' Project file into the QTCreator 5 as
![](Images/pic6-new.png)<br/>
after successfully import the project file as below
![](Images/pro-file.png)<br/>
click on the build-all from the build tab to successfuly build the code to the target system as<br/>
![](Images/Build-success.png)<br/>
after that click on Run Button to run the program as<br/>
![](Images/pic9.png)<br/>
## 4) Add the Use Case ##
![](Images/build-usecase.png)<br/>
after add new use case click on edit to add devices as
## 5) Add IoT Devices ##
![](Images/iot-device-add.png)<br/>
then fill the fields of device attributes as<br/>
![](Images/dev1.png)<br/>
![](Images/mqtt.png)<br/>
then device successfully added<br/>
![](Images/added-dev.png)<br/>
then save the device cong as XML as<br/>
![](Images/export.png)<br/>
<br/>
## 5) Run the Use Case and Generate Use Case Traffic ##
### Command to Run the xml File and gernerate the Traffic ###
#### From Source builds ####
Note:in case of build from source code the directory "build-IoTFlock1-Desktop_Qt_5_12_3_GCC_64bit-Debug" <br/>contains the binaries of the code so you have to open the directory and copy the<br/> file 'db2.sql' into folder "build-IoTFlock1-Desktop_Qt_5_12_3_GCC_64bit-Debug"<br/> and open in terminal write the below command to run the project.
#### From already builded bineries #####
open the directory named "CoAPIDS-Binaries" in the terminal and write the command to run the xml file<br/>
##### sudo ./IoTFlock-Console ./path of xml file/kitchencare.xml #####
Note: if file "./IoTFlock-Console" does not run then give the permission first as <br/>
sudo chmod +x IoTFlock-Console

Then the results is
