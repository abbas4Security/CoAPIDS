# CoAPIDS #
In this project, we enhanced Suricata IDS for the detection and prevention of assaults in CoAP networks, and within this framework, we evaluated the value of anomaly-based intrusion detection in preventing DoS attacks against such communication environments. In CoAP applications, it is crucial from a practical point of view to prevent as many intrusions as feasible when implementing an IDS system.

# README #
#In this project I (1) implemented an IoT project support (CoAP) into the open source IDS (Suricata). To test it follow Step#1.
#(2) An application for creating CoAP security policies. To test it follow Step#2. 
#(3) To validate my testing process please follow Step#3. 


Step#1: Implementation1-CoAPSuricata
---------------------------------------------
Please follow the README in the folder "Implementation1-CoAPSuricata" to execute and test CoAPIDS

Step#2: Implementation2-RuleCreation
---------------------------------------------
Please follow the README in the folder "Implementation2-RuleCreation" to create CoAP rules.

Step#3: Testing
---------------------------------------------
Please follow the README in the testing folder to test the project.
