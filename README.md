In this project, we enhanced Suricata IDS for the detection and prevention of assaults in CoAP networks, and within this framework, we evaluated the value of anomaly-based intrusion detection in preventing DoS attacks against such communication environments. In CoAP applications, it is crucial from a practical point of view to prevent as many intrusions as feasible when implementing an IDS system.
